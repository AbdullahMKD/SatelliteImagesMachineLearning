# LandUseClassification

## Description
LandUseClassification is a GUI application for satellite image classification using K-means clustering. This tool is designed to assist in the analysis and visualization of land use based on satellite imagery data, leveraging machine learning techniques for accurate classification.

## Installation

To install LandUseClassification, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LandUseClassification.git
   cd LandUseClassification
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   run_landuse_classifier
   ```

Alternatively, if the package is structured properly with a `setup.py`, you can also install it directly using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Features
- **K-means Clustering**: Utilize sophisticated machine learning algorithms to classify satellite images(JPG and PNG file Format).
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy to use interface for interacting with the tool and visualizing results.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large sets of satellite images efficiently.

## Usage
After installation, you can start the application by executing the command line utility:

```bash
run_landuse_classifier
```

Follow the GUI prompts to load your satellite images and begin classification.
