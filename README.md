LandUseClassification
Description

LandUseClassification is a GUI application for satellite image classification using K-means clustering. This tool is designed to assist in the analysis and visualization of land use based on satellite imagery data, leveraging machine learning techniques for accurate classification.
Installation

To install LandUseClassification, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LandUseClassification.git
cd LandUseClassification
