Actions this Week
=================

Action 1: Read research papers to come up with ideas on how to implement the Project.

Read through Several Research papers and came up with the Machine learning techniques
RF: Random forest,
CAST: Decion Tree Based Approach,
SVM approach,
Unsupervised Clustering approach Probabaly K-means
 
All can be Employed in either Object Based or Pixel Based Image Classification
Pixel based Classification will probably be best in our use case as It is less intensive on the system and more accurate and requires less training 
then the object based image classification

Action 2: Arrive on ROIs (regions of interest)

I belive 3 ROIs will be suffice for the Report: 
A large Metropolitan Area (Lahore), 
A Small Town in an Agrarian Area (Aberystwyth?), 
A Large area where no one lives except in the outskirts (Could be a Forest or desert or Mountainous Terrain)

Action 3: Data Sources

There are a lot of Data sources:
Satalite Data directly: Particularly Sentinal 2a from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem or any other Satalite (Landsat 8, landsat 5, etc...)
Universal Maps Downloader: Tool that allows you to download images to your specifications from Google Maps and Various other online maps
Screenshots from Google maps: Seems unprofessional?

=================
Question. Google Earth Engine API for python can I use it as it has built in Classifiers for RF, CAST, SVM, and K-Means clustering as well as others?
=================
Actions for next week

Find Implementations for Classifiers
Work on Project Overview
Work on project Timeline
Start Prototyping
Finalize and Get Data Sources
